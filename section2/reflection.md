## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

It depends if I have the opportunity presented. If there is an awkward silence, I may take the moment to throw a question out but typically I will sit an entire class not understanding with the plan to research and catch up on my own. Sometimes I will sporadically raise my hand to ask a question because I know it is the only way forward and it must be done but I try not to because I feel at fault for not knowing.

### If Statements

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

If this is true, execute this command.

If A is true or B is true, execute the command.

If C is true, execute D. Else don't execute anyone.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

To preform a function that you want to depend on single or multiple conditions.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

If ...
elsif...
else...
end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

You can add "elsif" (else if), "&&" (and) or "||" (or).

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

If A is true
  execute command
elsif
  execute command
else
  execute command
end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

Using a boolean variable to dictate an outcome

### Methods

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

To create a function/method that can be called upon when needed rather than duplicating it each time.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello()
  print '"Sam I am"'
end

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  print "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

I would type in the function name followed by the argument in parentheses

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?

Just need more time to get more comfortable creating and using them.
