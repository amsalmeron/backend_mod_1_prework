## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I enjoyed the SuperLearner Article. Many of the ideas I have been working on previously, but it is a nice refresher to be reminded about them. The focus on a growth mindset and the passion to teach others are probably my strongest learning qualities at the moment. I have been working on the physical health of my body/brain this past year and have noticed progress just need to work on consistency. It is the same with daily reading. Personally I would stress the importance of the growth mindset and not to be too hard on yourself with small setbacks. It is easy to talk yourself out of something because you think you failed, but in reality it is about pushing through the adversity and reaching the other side.

Interpolation uses known data to insert it inside another peice of data.

get.chomp
