## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

  I have just ordered my timer and am ready to implement the technique full cycle. That being said, reading about it has definitely brought about new ideas on how to productively plan workflow. I do now understand the importance of taking breaks but also making sure the designate productivity time is used effectively. Since the small implementation I do notice a happier more productive flow.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

  It was helpful, but I was a little too broad on my intentions and let outside distractions get in the way. This will take discipline to implement, both on beign distraction free but also being specific on what I wish to accomplish per allotted time.

1. In your own words, what is a Class?

  A class to me is a data set created to hold information used to be called upon when an object is designated within its parameters.

1. What is an attribute of a Class?

  An attribute is a characteristic or trait an object may have.

1. What is behavior of a Class?

  The behavior of a class is what one may want an object to preform, essentially a command to execute.

1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors:

```
  class Dog

    attr_accessor :breed, :color

    def introduction
      puts "The #{color} dog says Woof!"
    end

    def characteristic
      puts "Woof! I am a #{breed}."
    end

  end


```

1. How do you create an instance of a class?

  def initialize(name)

  end

1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?

I understand the concept of a class, still working on how to integrate it with methods correctly and bring it to interact with the rest of the code. Takes time, I am confident I will get there. Thank you.
