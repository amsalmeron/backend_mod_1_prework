## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  The two biggest points that resonated with me from both the article and video was that having a growth mindset is a conscious choice and is malleable. There is always rooms for improvement but also it is easy to get discouraged and move backward if one is not careful. I also agreed with the correlation of this mindset to learning to program because it can be very frustrating at points but the important part is to persevere and not give up.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  I demonstrate a growth mindset by focusing on learning new material and embracing the power of the human brain to grasp new ideas. I acknowledge our brain is a muscle and only gets stronger if one puts it to work.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

  A hash is a place to store values and differs from an array because rather than have each value located at a specific index one can link it to a key which can be any type of number or string.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

  pet_store = {
    food: liver,
    toy: sqeaky,
    bed: pillow,
    house: crate
  }

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

  states[:"IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

  states.keys

  states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

  A hash is used when we need to store data and we want to refer back to the data easily. It is easier to retrieve specific data from a hash because we can assign the value we are looking for to a specific key and reference it much more easily than an array.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

  I am curious whether these hashes are one way and if not how they differ from cryptographic hash fucntions.
